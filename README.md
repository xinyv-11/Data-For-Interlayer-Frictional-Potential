#Data-For-Interlayer-Frictional-Potential.zip

This file consists of four components, each of which corresponds to Figure 2 through Figure 5 in our study titled "Effect of metallicity on interlayer frictional potential energy of transition-metal dichalcogenides under normal load." Each component is labeled according to its respective figure number.

Figure 2: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and band information (PROCAR) of NbS₂ and MoS₂ monolayers and bilayers;

Figure 3: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and band information (PROCAR) of NbS₂ and MoS₂ under normal loading;

Figure 4: Energy decomposition data of NbS₂ and MoS₂ under normal loading;

Figure 5: Energy decomposition data of NbSe₂ and VS₂ under normal loading.
