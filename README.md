# Data-For-Interlayer-Frictional-Potential

This compressed archive contains four distinct folders，each of which corresponds to Figures 2 to 5 in our  work titled "Effect of metallicity on interlayer frictional potential energy of transition-metal dichalcogenides under normal load." 

Figure 2: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and band information (PROCAR) of NbS₂ and MoS₂ monolayers and bilayers;

Figure 3: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and band information (PROCAR) of NbS₂ and MoS₂ under normal loading;

Figure 4: Energy decomposition data of NbS₂ and MoS₂ under normal loading;

Figure 5: Energy decomposition data of NbSe₂ and VS₂ under normal loading.
